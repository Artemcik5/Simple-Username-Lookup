# Simple-Username-Lookup
This tool was my first project in python, I had many problems, used AI to fix most bugs and problems but I did learn a lot, I didn't see anyone making a tutorial since many people already made great tools for this.
This is just a heads up that this tool is very bad, unfinished, and not really good, only good thing is there is no installing.


## ðŸŽ® How to use ðŸŽ® 
Copy the main.py script or download it, and run it.
in the output you will see social media that were found, and errors, you can report issues but check if they aren't reported already.

## ðŸ˜¶ The Downsides.. ðŸ˜¶
Some, well most social media sites use bot protection which is hard to get around, stuff like Instagram for example just straight up wont let you go in the site and it will send you to a login page
You can report issues, but it's unfixable from what I know
